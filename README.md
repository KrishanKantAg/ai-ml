## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv ai-ml-env
source ai-ml-env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Learning Path

- Start with basic Python concepts
- Learn NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Explore Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Study Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Progress to deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras

## Notes

- Always activate your virtual environment before working
- Keep your notebooks organized by topic
- Document your learning progress
- Experiment with different datasets and algorithms

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
